// In this challenge you'll need to use the function setInterval. It works the same way as setTimeout, 
// but rather than executing the given function once after a delay, it executes it repeatedly. 
// For example, if we give 2000 for the number of milliseconds, the function will execute every 2 
// seconds:
// setInterval(myFunction, 2000); // myFunction will execute every 2 seconds
// In a new file counter.js:
// Declare a variable counter initialised at the value 0 — this value will need to change, so use let
//  rather than const.
// Declare a function called increment that:
// increments the value of counter by 1
// and prints it using console.log
// Using setInterval, call this function every second so the counter is incremented and printed every 
// second.
// If you've done the above correctly, you should be able to run the file and see the counter being 
// incremented and printed every second:

// $ node counter.js
// 1
// 2
// 3
// (...)

let counter = 0;
const increment = () => {
    counter += 1;
    console.log(counter);
}
setInterval(increment, 1000);
