// To complete this exercise, you will have to:
// Learn how to declare a class and its methods. Having a look at the Classes MDN documentation is 
// a good start.
// Initialise an attribute within the constructor special method
// Implement the User class in a file user.js so it behaves exactly like in the example code above.
// Require the file into the node REPL to verify the class is working.
